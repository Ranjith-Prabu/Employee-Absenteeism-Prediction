# Employee-Absenteeism-Prediction
It's a Time Series project. I used ARIMA model to predict the employee absenteeism. I also optionally applied Linear Regression to find the features impacting employee absenteeism. 
It's found that absenteeism is going to increase in the company in forth coming years due to health issues. Based on this several insights were given to the company to reduce employee absenteeism.
